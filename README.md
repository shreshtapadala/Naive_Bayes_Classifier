NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER

A machine learning algorithm technique used for classification tasks.

Naive Bayes Classifier is based on the Bayes theroem and assumes that features are conditionally independent of each other given the class label.

This algorithm calculates the probability of a data point belonging to each class and assigns it to the class with the highest probability.
